# Hey there and welcome to my GitHub RepoðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy, a petrophysicist / geoscientist with a passion for data science and machine learning. Over the past few years I have been interested in applying machine learning and data science techniques to petrophysical datasets, as well as exploring various libraries that can be used to visualise petrophysical and geoscience data. I also enjoy helping other geoscientists apply those techniques to their daily projects by sharing knowledge on YouTube, Medium and LinkedIn.

My main research interests are in data visualisation, data quality control and general machine learning applications in the geoscience domain.

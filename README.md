# Hey there and welcome to my GitHub RepoðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy, a petrophysicist / geoscientist with a passion for data science and machine learning. I enjoy helping other geoscientists apply those techniques to their daily projects by sharing knowledge on YouTube, Medium and LinkedIn.

My main research interests are in data visualisation, data quality control and general machine learning applications in the geoscience domain.
